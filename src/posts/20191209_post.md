Choosing your first programming language as a self-taught developer is a significant decision. Here's a simple guide to help you out:

<strong>Identify Your Goals:</strong> Determine what you want to achieve with programming. Do you want to build websites, mobile apps, games, or something else?

<strong>Research:</strong> Look into different programming languages and their uses. Consider factors like ease of learning, job opportunities, and community support.

<strong>Consider Your Interests:</strong> Choose a language that aligns with your hobbies, interests, your future goals, and the specific requirements of the projects you want to work on.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to choosing a programming language. Trust your instincts!
