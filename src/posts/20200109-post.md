Do you sometimes feel a lack of motivation?

Personally, I rarely do! I'm new to coding, and I love it. It might be because I don't have any previous experience in this fieldâ€”everything is fresh and new, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I feel more and more obsessed with coding every day.

But is it really just about motivation?

I don't think so! If you want to learn to code, develop the habit of coding every day, even if you don't feel motivated or inspired to write a single line. Don't force yourself, but make learning a part of your daily routine anyway. Why? What if you never feel motivated to do it? You might never progress or even start!

A small step forward is a step in the right direction!
