Do you feel a lack of motivation sometimes?

Personally me - 𝙧𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙮! I'm new to coding and I love it. It might be because I don't have any previous experience in this field - everything is fresh and new and I haven't got tired of it yet. I feel more and more obsessed with coding every day.

But is it really about motivation only?

I don't think so...:) If you want to learn to code - develop that habit every day - even if that day you don't feel motivated or inspired to write a line. Don't force yourself - but learning has to be a part of your day anyway. Why? What if you won't ever feel motivated to do that? You might never progress, or even start then!

A small step forward is a step in the right direction!

Happy coding!
