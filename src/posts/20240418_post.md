GNOME extensions are extra features that make the GNOME desktop look and work better. They let you change things like how your desktop looks or how you open apps, so you can make it just the way you like it.

Here’s the list of Gnome Extensions I use. I’m not some extensions freak, but if you know some good ones that I don’t have on my list - please share!
