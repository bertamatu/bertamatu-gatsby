How do you decide what colors should be on your web site or app? How do you choose them? Do you use color psychology tricks?

That's one of my favorite topics, especially when you don't have a designer by your side and you have to make your own decisions on the color palette for your project.

Color is a powerful communication tool! It can affect people in so many different ways..! If you don't know much about it, get some coffee or tea and google for color psychology!

ENJOY!
