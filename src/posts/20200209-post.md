How do you decide what colors should be on your website or app? How do you choose them? Do you use color psychology tricks?

This is one of my favorite topics, especially when you don't have a designer by your side and have to make your own decisions about the color palette for your project.

Color is a powerful communication tool! It can affect people in so many different ways. If you're not familiar with it, grab some coffee or tea and search for <strong>COLOR PSYCHOLOGY</strong> on Google.

Color psychology is the study of how colors affect human behavior, emotions, and perceptions. It explores how different colors can evoke specific feelings or reactions and how they are interpreted across various cultures and contexts.

Enjoy and thank me later!
