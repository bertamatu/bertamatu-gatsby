                            on Social networks (Instagram/Linkedin). Just after
                            finishing my studies, Covid happened. Everything got
                            closed. No coding academies, no workshops, no
                            meeting similar-minded people, nothing {'(!)'}. I
                            had to find ways to keep moving toward my software

                            with software developers outhere. I've shared my

                            in Lithuania. During these visits, I spoke to
