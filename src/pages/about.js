                            on Social networks (Instagram/Linkedin). Just after
                            finishing my studies, Covid happened. Everything got
                            closed. No coding academies, no workshops, no
                            meeting similar-minded people, nothing {'(!)'}. I
                            had to find ways to keep moving toward my software

                            decided to join Instagram and do some networking
                            with software developers outhere. I've shared my

                            in Lithuania. During these visits, I spoke to
                            students about the tech world, software engineering,
                            and startups, with the aim of encouraging them to be

                            service from idea to prototype. As a mentor, I
                            provided guidance and advice to the student teams,
                            along with other company representatives involved in
